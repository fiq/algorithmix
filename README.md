# WHAT?
A play ground with some algorithms

# Why?
Bored and wanted to do some kata's to remind myself how I'd injected
guice in a unit test. Will add more here and do some benchmarks.

Aiming to have time complexity optimised varients and break out of the habbit
of throwing streams at things.

# Why share?

I'd have stuck it in my private repo and no one would benefit. Sharing on the offchance that it helps someone.
